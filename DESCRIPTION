Description: 
  This software assesses the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve at
  adjusted thresholds, enabling the comparison of sensitivity and specificity
  across multiple binary classification models. Instead of comparing different
  models with varied cutoff values in their risk thresholds, all models can be
  compared at a fixed threshold of sensitivity, a fixed threshold of specificity, 
  or the crossing point between sensitivity and specificity. If a threshold for
  specificity is given (e.g., specificity = 0.9), sensitivity and its confidence
  interval are computed, and vice versa. If the threshold for either sensitivity 
  or specificity is not provided, the crossing point between the sensitivity and
  specificity curves is returned, along with their confidence intervals. For
  bootstrap procedures, the software evaluates the mean and CI bootstrap values
  for sensitivity, specificity, and the crossing point between specificity and
  sensitivity. This allows users to discern whether the performance of a model
  (based on adjusted sensitivity or adjusted specificity) is significantly different
  from other models. This software addresses the issue of comparing different
  classification models with varying predefined cutoff thresholds, which often
  leads to inconclusive results due to the fluctuating values of both sensitivity 
  and specificity.
